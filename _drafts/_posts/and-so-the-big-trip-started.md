After so many months of work, the "Holiday" part of our Working Holiday Visa finally began. We left Gayndah with our two best friends, the Froio brothers, heading south, prepared for our big trip around Australia.

We drove again on the Pacific Highway towards Sydney, stopping from time to time in the places that we missed the first time: Lennox Head, Coffs Harbour, Treachery Bay and Jervis Bay.

This post will tell the story of this part of the trip, mainly in the East Coast.

We have to say, we really love vanlife. Swimming in the ocean, walking in the National Parks, relaxing for me and surfing (or at least trying to) for Ricky. We usually wash ourselves in the public showers that are usually next to the beach e we sleep where we are, being that a rest area on the highway or a secluded parking on a residential suburb.

This is one of the best places to surf and people come from all over the world for the spectacular waves of this little Queensland town. There is a chill-out atmosphere, typical of a touristic beach town. The city centre is small but very nice, full of small restaurant, cafes and (of course) surf shops.

_Seal Rocks, NSW_ – While we were waling to the lighthouse we were lucky enough to see dolphins swimming freely in the ocean. They get very close to the beach and some of them like to surf the waves in the same way we do.

Still at Seal Rocks, we stopped for our usual pasta lunch, when we spotted this "little" spider near our table, half hidden between the leaves. Too bad it was the most dangerous spider in Australia: the funnel web spider. One single bite could be enough to kill you!

We didn't want to kill him but at the same time, we didn't even want to die, so we quickly decided to move all our stuff and have lunch somewhere else. Five minutes later, while we were still packing, mother nature decided to help us: a kookaburra (typical Australian bird) nosedived right on there and swallowed the poor spider. An important lesson on the food chain was taught that day: you can be scary and dangerous but you are never invincible.

Thanks Kookaburra friend!

Una delle poche cose che il nostro van non può ospitare è la lavatrice, per cui si va in quelle a gettoni quando si raggiungono delle città.

Una sera abbiamo parcheggiato il van in un posto desolato davanti alla spiaggia, salvo poi scoprire che era in corso una festa di spagnoli e/o sudamericani. Tutti ubriachissimi, musica alta, e tende sulla spiaggia. Il mattino seguente abbiamo fatto colazione guardando l’oceano, e mentre loro si svegliavano ancora rintronati, degli australiani erano già in giro in canoa con le prime luci del sole!

Jervis Bay

Jervis Bay National Park – Alcuni canguri hanno completamente perso il naturale istinto di paura nei confronti degli uomini e si fanno accarezzare nonché cibare da tutti i passanti!

Phillip Island – Siamo pure andati a visitare la famosa Phillip Island, dove tra le altre cose, c’è il circuito di motoGP. L’unica cosa che potevamo fare, privi di ogni mezzo motorizzato da corsa, era noleggiare dei kart e sfidarci su una piccola riproduzione del circuito vero.

Phillip Island National Park – Qui ci sono delle onde stupende per chi sa surfare bene, molto meno belle per chi ha appena cominciato! Riki è stato ore nell’acqua senza prendere nemmeno un’onda.

Phillip Island National Park – Sebbene l’uscita in surf non sia andata benissimo, il tramonto è stato comunque emozionante e le luci uniche.
