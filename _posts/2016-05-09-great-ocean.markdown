One of the most spectacular road in Australia is the Great Ocean Road.
It starts not long west of Melbourne and it keeps going for 250km along the southern coast of Victoria towards Adelaide, the capital of South Australia.
It's not a highway and it's definitely not the shorter or faster road connecting the two major cities, but it's a spectacular drive on the edge of the southern coastline.

It officialy starts in a small town called Torquay, famous for being the birthplace of important surfing brands such as Quicksilver and Rip Curl. It is actually a really chilled out and relaxed place where surfing is just what people do to enjoy life, besides having a beer or heading to the local Sunday market.
One beach in particular is renowned for the big swells it has all year round, and for this reason it has been chosen as the venue for the Rip Curl Pro, a title of the World Championship Tour of surfing.

We spent a couple of days in this small town because we really had positive vibes from it. We even decided it was time for a BBQ after so many days without a proper meal - and by that I mean we were just feeding ourselves with tons of pasta. So we bought the infamous 8$ wurstel pack and we headed down to the first public park with free BBQs. What's better than a sunny day, some good-smelling meat grilling and an after lunch nap on the grass?

On the first part of the Great Ocean Road it's just nice to drive along and enjoy the scenery without even stopping too often. There are not particular attractions but on one side there's the magnificent shoreline with some spectacular cliffs and enormous waves that, by breaking onto the coast, make a nice water dust that rise up to the road itself. On the right side there's the eucalyptus forests and its smell that fill up your nose.
Sometimes this view is interrupted by small town and villages with just a nice and easy athmosphere.

When we were about to cross Wye River town, the landscape changed dramatically, from a bright and alive green color to a dry and depressing brown and black. Yurika even said "it might be the autumn coming...", but unfortunately was that a terrible bushfire affected this area last December, just during Christmas...

Luckily, not long after this sad scenery we cheered up seeing for the first time what might be the symbol of Australian wildlife: the koala! These slow and fatty little bears manage to balance on a small and weak branch on top of the trees. They even stick out to reach for the far leaves, risking to fall everytime they do...
The koala peculiarities, like those of many other Australian animals, come from the adaptation to the harsh and dry Australian conditions where the food is scarce and the life is difficult. Surviving here is not only finding food but also save on your energy as much as possible: that's why the koala spend so much time sleeping and move so slowly!

The road keeps going south until it reaches Apollo Bay and the Great Otway National Park. We spent the night camping in our van in the middle of the forest, surrounded by nothing but trees and... other five backpackers cars! Next morning we explored the forest around us, amazed by some of the biggest trees we have ever saw.

The Great Ocean Road comes to an end with its most spectacular part: the twelve apostles and the surrounding area. They're enormous stone pillars that pop up into the ocean like they dropped from the sky, but instead they are just the outcome of a slow and steady water erosion of the coastline. While they are big and majestic, they also feel weak because their shape is so unnatural: large on top and skinny at the base. Some of them look like they're about to fall down and some of them already did: in fact the twelve apostles are now eight because the rest of them have collapsed.

The road keep keeps going to Adelaide, but as the Great Ocean Road finishes, the landscape quickly changes from coastline to pine forests and then to flat land full of vineyards.

And then, probably because we had nothing else to do or see, Yurika decorated our van with some nice herbs and plants.

And then it all ended in Adelaide, the capital of South Australia, one of the least populated and driest state. It is an unusual "spacious" city compared to other capitals on the East Coast that we were used to see. Roads are large and not crowded and people is not everywhere. It has a feel of a small town that became big.
Unfortunately, even if we were supposed to be happy, we couldn't manage to suppress the awful feeling that our trip had come to an end. Here in Adelaide we had to split with our friends and while they were going to Alice Springs, we were going to Perth alone... but life doesn't always go as planned, especially here in Australia, and we were about to find out...
