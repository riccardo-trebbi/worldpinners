In Naples, Italy, there is the "Naples splitter" - a road that cut Naples in half.
The Stuart Highway is the Australia splitter, the road that cuts the country vertically in half,
traverses three different climate regions and is 2800km long, from South to North.
It is an extraordinary road trip, full of sceneries that we had never seen in our life, but it's a trip that... we weren't supposed to do.

Why? Because our plan was to cut through the Nullarbor straight to Western Australia, so that we could have found a last job before going back to Italy. Australia is as wonderful as expensive, so we were quickly running out of money during this trip. The idea of coming back home full of money to brag with friends and family was so tempting!
Too bad that plans are meant to be broken. While we were driving around Adelaide in a sunny afternoon we thought: "What if we get to Perth, yes, but going through the North?", "If we stay really tight and try not to spend too much we can do it!", and so on with other nonsense thinking...
Of course we were not ready to start working yet and we were not ready to leave our friends yet and we were not ready to stop our trip yet... but most of all we didn't want to loose such a precious opportunity to see another big part of this country that maybe we would have never had the opportunity to see again.

This is also a remote part of Australia, with long empty road strips between each service station (200km on average), so having a breakdown there alone wouldn't have been the best of things. Having some friends with us would was a great help. We had not only two friends but seven!
Some German girls decided to join us - without really asking - and so we were a road train of five cars moving together. We also had some walkie-talkie to speak while driving for arranging stops or just commenting on the landscape around us!

Just an hour north of Adelaide the scenery starts to change drastically, turning into dry land, short bushes. Rarely a salt lake or a road train - a long truck with as much as four trailers - interrupts the view which is monotonous but also immense and hypnotic. Sunsets here are magical, there is a whole spectrum of colors ranging from dark blue to violet and red and yellow, it's really powerful to watch!

After about 400km we got to the first town, Coober Pedy, economically based on opal mining and not beautiful in the canonical sense of beauty but definitely interesting in its own dry and martian look.

About half the houses here are built under the ground, really like a mine. This provides a great insulation against the harsh conditions of the outside world. Just walking along the streets we soon realised how good that idea was: the heat is unbearable and the flies lay everywhere in your face - they particularly like the inside of your eyes.

The whole city perimeter is packed of mines and there are thousands of deep holes everywhere. They were dug to look for opals and then never filled up because no money would come from filling up a hole back. Many signs and people will warn you not to go around at night because a lot tourists had fallen down in these holes and it's very dangerous not to look where you're going here.

The next day we hit the road again: 5th gear that never changes for hours, walkie-talkie on one hand and ice-cold coke on the other. After an entire day of driving, when we were almost falling asleep by the boredom of the road, finally the Northern Territory border popped up out of nowhere and in the middle of nowhere.
We decided we would call it a day and camped right there in the rest area nearby. We had dinner with a german guy with whom we shared our adventures talk, and we also met an Australian man who was cycling with his bike on the Stuart Highway.

The night was silent and quiet except for two dogs that were abandoned at that rest area by an awful owner. They howled all night after eventually falling asleep under our van. The next morning Yurika and I seriously considered taking them with us but after much thinking we decided it wasn't a great idea after all. If only we had a bigger van we would have put them on without any doubt, but unfortunately these guys had to wait for another good soul on the road...
