Not long after crossing the border between SA and NT, we met one of the rare crossroads along the Stuart Hwy. Taking the left and you'll make a detour to the famous Uluru mountain, keeping straight and you'll be in Alice Springs in a few hours.
Even if the detour is not exactly quick - 600km round trip - we were in no hurry at all, so we obviously headed toward the most famous mountain of Australia, its symbol nonetheless.

There is a stunning natural treasure, a giant monolithic stone that pops out of nothing like it was dropped from the sky (which is a theory some people seriously believe). We loved it and we admired it for long, in the middle of the day, at sunrise or at sunset and we took pictures at every possible angle.

It is a fascinating place, but full of contradictions: first and foremost the importance it has for indigenous people is completely disregarded by the government, even if they pretend to care. They have placed signs everywhere asking not to climb the mountain because it's sacred for native Australians - climbing was a very important ritual reserved to them only - but still they never forbidden it. Plus they charge for this park almost double the price of any other park in the country and they build resorts, hotels, restaurants and service stations all around the place.

But the power of this place is really strong and even bad management can't take it all away. At sunset, when the last lights are leaving the sky, it stands out alone in the horizon and it makes you feel really small and powerless just by watching it. We really hope that something will be done in the future, even if it will mean that less tourists - us included - will be allowed around the place. Australia was not nobody's land when European first arrived, but it belonged for thousands of years to indigenous. The least we can do is leaving their sacred places untouched.

After spending the night in a bush campsite, watching a spectacular, untouched and unspoiled sky full of stars, the next day we visited Kata Tjuta, a mountain that is sitting next to Uluru and is often overlooked by many. Its color and shape resemble a lot those of Uluru, but it has its own particular look: it's composed of many different monolithic rocks, so close to each other that they form gorge looking paths between them.

Have we mentioned that this place is full of flies? Full like you can't even eat without swallowing a couple of them! So we had to go around dressed with a mosquito net on our faces. We were not good looking but it definitely helped...

Not far from the Uluru and Kata Tjuta National Park there is another national treasure, that easily overtakes both of them in how spectacular it is.
The road that is leading to the canyon is full of attractions as well: camels! They are not native of Australia but they were imported from Africa because they do very well in the dry conditions. It was very weird when we saw an entire herd at the side of the road just chilling and looking for food but unfortunately we were not able take a picture quick enough so these are just the ones we met in a farm nearby.

The canyon instead was absolutely fantastic, we walked a good hour to get to the summit but the view from there was great and a bit scary. There is no fencing so you're free to look down into the cliff but beware, you can be summoned by the leader of a group of scout that's passing next to you.
The whole trek we felt like being on Mars because of the dry and dead landscapes around us. But the life was there, just hiding away from the tourists and the strong sun!

On that same night we camped in a small and empty rest area in the middle of the desert. All around us was the silence and the sound of the wind, rarely interrupted by the roar of a road train passing by. Too many nights had passed where we shut the doors of our van for fear of the mosquitoes getting in and disturbing our sleep. This time we decided it was enough. We went around and collected some wood, we lit a big fire and while sipping a hot tea we stayed outside chatting and watching the millions of stars dotting the sky.
It was right there that we realised how beautiful and inspiring this trip was being to us.
We were just having the freedom to stay there without any worries or duties for the next day.
Just enjoying the nature and the pleasure of other human beings. That was something truly special...
