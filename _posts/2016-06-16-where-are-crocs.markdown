We left Darwin on an April night, determined to reach the first rest area along the way south. We would have slept there for free once again that night. We've always tried not to drive at night in Australia, dangers are multiples and diverse, they said, you will hit kangaroos or, worse, a road train. And it is actually a bit frightening, driving on a road without the palest illumination on the side, surrounded by the deepest dark and the occasional sun-like flash of a road-train lights.

Luckily we had no problem reaching our place that night and we could a get a good night sleep, to prepare ourselves to the next big day. Next morning, we were back on the road! But this time the sun was on our back so we were definitely going West!

The road is impressively even less populated than the Stuart Hwy. Just a few other cars are met during the day, and most of them are trucks or campervans like ours. Some could argue that the landscape is not interesting at all, but every single view was particular and new for us, interesting in its own way. The vast sky, the endless and inhabited green and yellow lands, rarely interrupted by birds looking for the already elusive water.

Everywhere we heard that the great north was the land of crocodiles. In every stream of water, you had to be careful not to meet them. But we met no crocodile for days, even if we looked in every small or big river that we crossed along the way. No sign of them! Only consolation was this little guy here, the baobab, that we started to see more and more often at the side of the road.

And at the end, after hours of empty roads and the occasional baobab, we reached the last and the greatest of all the Australian states (ok, we still miss Tasmania...shhhh)

And right there, ready to destroy our enthusiasm, were the local authorities, who kindly inspected our van and decided our little plants were a too much of a risk for the Western Australia environment... Solution: we had to take them out and throw them away. Goodbye little friends! We will miss you! (Yurika most of all)

But as the Australians always say, no worries! This land has a lot to take, but a lot to give as well. So after a few kilometers off the border, we found this gorgeous place, the pool of the dreams. It's actually called the Infinity Pool and it's right beside the Argyl Lake, the second largest fresh water and man made lake in Australia. What a view!

Being so excited by this new discovery and the first swim we had in days since we were back on the road, we cleverly locked ourselves out of the van... with only our swimsuits on. With a bit of luck and some mesh, Yurika luckily solved the situation very McGiverly...by pulling up the lock from a small gap in the car window.

But anyway, back to our main reason for being up north, still no trace of crocodiles yet! We were starting to get hopeless, because our closest encounters were just these.

With a tad of sadness but still full of hope, we hit the road again and after days of travelling we finally got to Broome. It was so beatiful to meet the ocean and the beach again. It gave us a sense of freshness and ease of life that the desert spared us for so long.

Our two cents on Broome is that it is not exceptionally beautiful like many depicts it. It's fine as a town but most of the towns on the East Coast are far more beautiful. What we found interesting though, is that here we met our beloved animal: the crocodile. We may have eased the casualty of the thing by visiting a natural reservoir... This is the Malcolm Douglas Wildlife Park.

We have watched them doing everything: hiding, jumping, swallowing whole chickens and playing with a plastic ball. We had definitely satisfied our desire of seeing them! Too bad that we didn't even see one of them wild and free, maybe next to our van one night while we were camping next to a river... Imagine waking up to this view...

So maybe it was better we haven't actually seen them in the wild...
