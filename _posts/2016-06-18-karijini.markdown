Tropical Australia was about to end. Landscape was changing already after leaving Broome and through our van windows we could start to see desert lands again, small bushes and a lot of red sand.

We had a map of Australia hanging inside the van, reminding us where we were going, so the idea we had at the time was that Western Australia coast was exactly the same as the East Coast but with maybe less towns and less civilization.
But instead Western Australi was nothing but DESERT for probably 80% of the land! East Coast is muuuch more green compared to here!

So again, we had to face thousands of kilometers of empty, straight and boring road, without the chance to pullover and enjoying the relaxing shade of a tree. There are not a lot of service station here as well as along the Stuart Hwy, so we prayed again that our van wouldn't abandon us right there...

The first city after Broome is Port Hedland, just 600 km far...
It's much more a gigantic industrial zone than a proper city: a huge port that looks like a post-modern scenario, cargo trains that literally never end and a lot of salt mines.

Port Hedland is really the perfect... stop to refill the tank and then head to the wonderful Karijini National Park!!!
This park is just a few hours drive from Port Hedland and it's one of the best parks we've seen in Australia: with beautiful gorges and natural pools it's an oasis in the middle of the desert.

For days we haven't stop walking...and everytime we had something different, new and fascinating to see.
Sometimes tracks were easy...

And sometimes a bit rough...

We went through rivers, we climbed and sometimes we just had to swim through parts of the trek. But the show at the end of the way never failed to impress us.

After a few days in this paradise we had to hit the road again...And that's when we had our first (and only) breakdown during this trip. After so many kms of faithful service, our beloved van decided it was too much for its old body and stopped in the middle of the road...
But we know there is a soul and a heart inside him as well, so even if it broke down, it was so kind to break the fuel pump. Basically, being an LPG van (it can run on both LPG and petrol), the fuel pump is the only thing that we can live without.
Not so easy though... This is also a part of Australia where LPG is reeeally rare to find, so we used to just fill the fuel tank and not care about the LPG. So when the fuel pump broke down, we switched on LPG and prayed the gas didn't run out until the first service station, and prayed also that the first service station was selling gas as well.
This time some angel was protecting us, because both of the things went as expected and so we could reach Carnarvon where we fixed the van (for 600$!!!).

Needless to say, after the big expense of Carnarvon, we knew our trip was nearly over, we had to stop and find a job or something similar...
We decided that one last destination to celebrate this wonderful road-trip was more than essential: and so we went to Shark Bay.

And then Eagle Bluff, with its crystal waters and its stories of sharks and dolphins. We haven't seen either of them but instead we met a funny, and a bit crazy, Scottish guy, with whom we exchanged travel stories and jokes for a while.

At the end of Shark Bay, there is Denham, a tiny sea town with its parks, public bbqs and everything very well organized and tidy. The only noteworthy attraction is a church built with sea shells.

And maybe these funny guys walking across the road from time to time...

![Emu crossing the street](https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7726/26713783070_b4dbc16559_c.jpg){:class="img-fluid"}

This is the beloved Australian Emu, similar to the well-known ostrich that everybody know from Will-E and Coyote, but strange and different like every other australian thing...
