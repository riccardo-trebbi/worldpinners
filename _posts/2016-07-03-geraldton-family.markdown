And so, without even realizing it, our Australia-wide trip had come to an end. We had finally arrived to Geraldton, the first town with some green around the houses after thousand of kilometers of nothingness. And here, given our growing money problem, we had two options: either stay camping around doing nothing all day or trying to find something to do.

Of course we opted for the first option at first because, honestly, we were quite over the all "working for someone else" thing; we had even found a wonderful place where we parked our van and finally camped legally.

It was in front of the ocean and even a popular surfers' secret spot, so we couldn't ask for more... During the day we usually walked on the beach, watch the ocean while reading a book, or just spend hours cooking a nice meal and at night we just watched some movie or talk to each other.
After a long time of being busy, having nothing to do all day was quite enjoying and relaxing...at first!
But just couple of days of this were enough to get us bored so we began to look around for something to do: finding a job was not a good idea since we had to leave Australia in just a month, but helpx was perfect!

And so we met the Tonkin family!

It was great to get back to a proper house after so many months in a van, so Yurika took the chance to cook every possible recipe that she had in mind: japanese gyoza, lasagna, pasta, sushi, ramen...

And, of course, our traditional tortellini...the pride of every bolognese!

And do we want to mention all the desserts Yurika baked? Kate, the mother of the family, truly fell in love with her thanks to these treaties!

Tiramisu in particular made everyone laugh when we explained that it can be translated as lift me up and it was often sold near brothels as an aphrodisiac for clients. It didn't matter if the stories were true or not, Kate and Chris were always fascinated and genuinely interested so we kept telling new ones (most of them were true, but sometimes, if we couldn't remember something, we used a bit of our immagination).

By the way, I didn't really help Yurika during that time...

We even had the chance to meet some family friends who kept kangaroos in their backyard as pets. So we fed kangaroos for the first time in our life...

In the weekend nights, as a perfect Aussie family, we used to to enormous bonfires in the garden. Sometimes to burn the weeds and sometimes to just enjoy a camping cooked dinner watching the light.

Geraldton was our home for an entire month and what a wonderful place we chose!
We truly loved this house from the very first second we stepped into it.
Yet again HelpX was a great experience that taught us many new skills and made us meet stupendous people.

Goodbye Tonkins, we will miss you!
