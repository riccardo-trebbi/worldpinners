After so many months of work, the "Holiday" part of our Working Holiday Visa finally began. We left Gayndah with our two best friends, the Froio brothers, heading south, prepared for our big trip around Australia.

We drove again on the Pacific Highway towards Sydney, stopping from time to time in the places that we missed the first time: Lennox Head, Coffs Harbour, Treachery Bay and Jervis Bay.

This post will tell the story of this part of the trip, mainly in the East Coast.

We have to say, we really love vanlife. Swimming in the ocean, walking in the National Parks, relaxing for me and surfing (or at least trying to) for Ricky. We usually wash ourselves in the public showers that are usually next to the beach e we sleep where we are, being that a rest area on the highway or a secluded parking on a residential suburb.  
  
![Noosa Heads](https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1490/25851035963_2272c09a9a_c.jpg "Noosa Heads, QLD"){:class="img-fluid"} _Noosa Heads, QLD_ - Riki finally catches his first waves here although there are no photographic proofs. This is one of the best places to surf and people come from all over the world for the spectacular waves of this little Queensland town. There is a chill-out atmosphere, typical of a touristic beach town. The city centre is small but very nice, full of small restaurant, cafes and (of course) surf shops.

_Seal Rocks, NSW_ – While we were waling to the lighthouse we were lucky enough to see dolphins swimming freely in the ocean. They get very close to the beach and some of them like to surf the waves in the same way we do.

Still at Seal Rocks, we stopped for our usual pasta lunch, when we spotted this "little" spider near our table, half hidden between the leaves. Too bad it was the most dangerous spider in Australia: the funnel web spider. One single bite could be enough to kill you!

We didn't want to kill him but at the same time, we didn't even want to die, so we quickly decided to move all our stuff and have lunch somewhere else. Five minutes later, while we were still packing, mother nature decided to help us: a kookaburra (typical Australian bird) nosedived right on there and swallowed the poor spider. An important lesson on the food chain was taught that day: you can be scary and dangerous but you are never invincible.

Thanks Kookaburra friend!

We tried to equip our van with as many things as possible to make it similar to a normal house, but we couldn't fit a laundry machine. Once in a while we have to stop at the laundrettes when we pass through towns.

One night we parked our van in what we though was a secluded place in front of the beach. Soon enough we found out there was a big party going on, full of overseas people, mostly Spanish and South Americans. They were all very drunk with loud music and more than 20 tents on the beach. The next morning we had breakfast on the beach and while they were trying to wake up hung over, some local Aussies were already paddling their canoes in the ocean!

_Jervis Bay National Park_ – Some kangaroos have completely lost their fear for humans and they let people pet and feed them!

_Phillip Island_ – We even visited Philip Island, famous for its MotoGP circuit. The only thing we could do there was renting some karts and challenging each other on a small recreation of the real circuit.

_Phillip Island National Park_ – There are marvellous waves here if you can seriously surf, less fun if you just started. Riki spent hours in the water without catching a single wave.

_Phillip Island National Park_ – The surfing might have not been successful but the sunset was unbelievably beautiful. This peace, this lights and these sounds were all what we came here in Australia for.
