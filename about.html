    <h5>What is this blog?</h5>
    <p>
        Too many times, coming back from a spectacular trip, we didn't know what to tell to family and friends asking us
        "tell us about your experience".
        It's a mix of not being very good at telling stories and not remembering them at all.<br>
        WorldPinners was born to remember and share. It is our story of travelling the world and although we haven't
        started from
        the first trip, we definitely started with
        the most important: our long Japan-Australia trip.

        WorldPinners means, at least in our mind, that we want to pin the world. We have a beautiful cork map at
        home that we put pins on everytime we visit a new country. It is not a race for sure, but it's fun to see pins
        popping up everywhere and get inspiration on new places to visit.

        We met in the summer of 2012 in our hometown Bologna. Our passion for travelling pushed us to discover
        new places together everytime we had the chance. We have been to the Balkans with an old Fiat Punto, to India travelling in shitty trains
        and getting sick together and in many other destinations sharing awesome experiences.

        Riccardo works as a software engineer
        and his great passion
        is Calisthenics and Street Workout. As a matter of facts, he always try to find time to train even using tree branches or tables and chairs.
        He also love music, travelling and, of course, good food.

        Yurika studied International Relationships but she later found out that her passion is
        cooking. She is now trying to
        start her personal career in the bakery business or in a handmade pasta making business. She also loves
        to
        travel and good food. She would never miss an opportunity to enjoy a good piece of cake.
